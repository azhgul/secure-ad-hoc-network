I've added an exit code:
 - Exit Code 7 - Less than 30 API calls remaining, or if there's an unknown error.
 
Otherwise I've followed all exit code specifications. 
I therefore also exit the program with code 2 when authentication fails, even in interactive mode.

I have not implemented url-shortening, but everything else should be implemented. 
No segfaults should occur either.
